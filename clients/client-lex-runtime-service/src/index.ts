/**
 * <p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint
 *       provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the
 *       runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For
 *       example, suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to
 *       Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user
 *       request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the
 *       bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to
 *       elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust
 *       type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when
 *       you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your
 *       Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time
 *       API, . </p>
